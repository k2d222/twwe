# Teeworlds Web Editor (TWWE)

![TWWE on Sunny Side Up by Ravie.](screenshots/sunny.png)

Teeworlds / DDraceNetwork map editor. Online and collaborative, just like the game.

A demo server is hosted at [tw.thissma.fr](https://tw.thissma.fr). A DDNet server is hosted with the name `twwe -- tw.thissma.fr` (ip: `82.64.235.33:8303`).


## Development Status (Oct. 2023)

The app is now mostly compatible with ddnet editor.
Bugs are expected. It is advised to save regularly and if a bug happens, log out and back in to roll back to the previous save.
Maps corruptions are unlikely to happen though thanks to @patiga's [twmap library](https://gitlab.com/Patiga/twmap).

### DDNet Compatibility

The table below shows the feature parity with ddnet's in-game map editor.

## Usage

Explore the UI, it resembles the ddnet editor for the most part.

### Using the website

You can use this editor by simply going to [tw.thissma.fr](https://tw.thissma.fr). You should see the default server with a bunch of maps that others created. For the default server, a ddnet server is also running with name `twwe -- tw.thissma.fr` on which you can test your map immediately. The server is reloaded each time the map is saved.

### Using the standalone app

Alternatively, you can [install the app](https://github.com/k2d222/twwe/releases) to use the editor offline. On startup, the editor will look for maps in the various ddnet folders.

With the external editor, you can also enable sharing your map (top-right button), which gives access to you map to other users via one of the servers.

Additionally: 
 * <kbd>üñ±Ô∏è Right</kbd> opens context-menus on quad points, envelope points and envelope lines.
 * You can select multiple layers with `shift`.
 * The Save button saves the map on the disk on the server side. If a teeworlds server using this map is running, enter `reload` in the server console to update it.

## Building and Running

The code is split into a client, a desktop and a server part. The client generates a static site (html, js, ‚Ä¶) that you can host wherever you want or even run locally. The server is a HTTP and WebSocket server that the client connects to. The maps are stored on the server machine.

the server can be installed from cargo: `cargo install twwe-server`

### Server

Have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and cargo installed. And create a server/maps/ directory with your .map files in it.

Run the server with `twwe-server --maps <path_to_maps_dir>` to run in release mode with debugging info printed to stdout.

Use the first command-line argument to change address and port e.g. `twwe-server localhost:3333 --maps ...` to run locally on port 3333.

Use the `--cert` and `--key` arguments to enable TLS support for websocket. They must point to your PEM certificate and private key.

Use the `--rpp <path>` argument to enable Rules++ support (experimental). `<path>` must be the **absolute** path to a directory containing: `rpp` (the rpp executable), `base.r` and `base.p`.

#### Limits

The HTTP server is rate-limited per IP. It allows bursts of 8 requests and then 500ms between requests. This is currently not configurable.

The `--max-maps <Amount>` argument limits the number of maps created by users. The `--max-map-size <MiB>` argument limits the size of each map file.

#### Server bridging

With the desktop client, it is possible to connect a "bridge" to a remote server (e.g. pi.thissma.fr:16900), to allow other users to access and edit a map on your hard drive from the internet. This feature has security implications for both the server and the client, so make sure you understand them before enabling bridging.

 * For the client, enabling bridge essentially gives the internet a direct access to the map file on your computer. Anyone who has access to the passphrase can do damage to your map file. Make sure you make a backup and trust the people with whom you share the passphrase.
 * For the server, bridging initiates a connection to an arbitrary websocket url chosen by the client. Make sure your server may not leak the local network or connect to unwanted networks.

The `bridge_out` and `bridge_in` feature flags guard this feature and are disabled by default. You can enable them with `cargo run --feature bridge_in -- ...`.

### Client

Copy the `env.example` file to `.env` or `.env.production` and configure the websocket server url.

Have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed and run `npm install` in the client directory to install dependencies, `npm run dev` to run a dev server and `npm run build` to produce a release in the `dist` directory.

Note: the client is written in non-strict Typescript. Typescript is only used for IDE hints and documentation, but ignored by the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#typescript) bundler. Use `npm run check` to run Typescript checks on the project.

### Desktop

The desktop client is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) web-app that you can install and enables editing your local map files like the default editor. You can also enable sharing your maps over the internet (read [Server bridging](#server-bridging)).

The app spins up a localhost server on port 16800. It looks for maps in the "standard" ddnet folders (see storage.cfg: $USERDIR, $DATADIR and $CURRENTDIR).
